## Cycle Through Panes

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This project uses Typescript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

**Note:** The Obsidian API is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!

### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.
